# ADR-0001: Modular, Event-Driven, Cloud-Native Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system must support CSV ingestion, persistence, event streaming,
secure authentication, and optional blockchain anchoring while remaining
deployable both locally and in the cloud.

## Decision
The system is split into **independent Maven modules** with clear
responsibilities, deployed as containerized services on Cloud Run.

Key principles:
- Separation of concerns
- Explicit dependency boundaries
- Cloud-native deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

## Consequences
- Modules can evolve independently
- Clear ownership and testing boundaries
- Increased initial design effort
