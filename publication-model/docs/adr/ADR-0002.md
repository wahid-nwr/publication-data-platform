# ADR-0002: Centralized Publication Domain Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Books and magazines share common attributes (ISBN, title, authors),
but have different lifecycle and representation concerns.

## Decision
Introduce a shared domain model module:
- `Publication` interface
- `PublicationModel` abstract base class
- Concrete implementations: `Book`, `Magazine`
- DTOs separated from domain entities

## Rationale
- Prevent duplication across services
- Enforce consistency across Kafka, persistence, and blockchain
- Enable canonical serialization for hashing

## Consequences
- Domain model changes affect downstream modules
- Requires careful versioning discipline
