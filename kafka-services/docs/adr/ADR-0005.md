# ADR-0005: Kafka for Publication Events

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Downstream systems (indexing, analytics, auditing) should not be tightly
coupled to persistence logic.

## Decision
- Use Kafka as the event backbone
- Publish publication lifecycle events
- Support Schema Registry
- Configuration externalized via environment variables

## Rationale
- Decouples producers and consumers
- Enables extensibility without code changes
- Industry-standard streaming platform

## Consequences
- Operational complexity
- Requires schema governance
