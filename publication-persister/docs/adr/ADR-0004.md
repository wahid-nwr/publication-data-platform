# ADR-0004: Explicit Batch-Oriented Persistence

## Status
Accepted

## Context
ORM frameworks can retain entities in memory, leading to GC pressure
during large imports.

## Decision
- Use JPA/Hibernate without Spring container
- Persist entities in fixed-size batches
- Clear persistence context after each batch
- Optionally use StatelessSession for bulk operations

## Rationale
- Full control over memory and transaction boundaries
- Avoids hidden persistence context growth
- Optimized for large-scale ingestion

## Consequences
- Manual transaction management
- More boilerplate compared to Spring Data
