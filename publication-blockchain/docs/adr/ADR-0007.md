# ADR-0007: Blockchain Anchoring for Integrity Proof

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Some use cases require immutable proof that publication data existed
in a specific state at a specific time.

## Decision
- Canonicalize publication data
- Compute SHA-256 hash
- Store hash on Ethereum-compatible chain (Sepolia)
- Smart contract enforces idempotency

## Rationale
- Verifiable integrity without storing sensitive data on-chain
- Optional and non-blocking
- Demonstrates Web3 interoperability

## Consequences
- Added operational cost
- Transaction latency
- Not suitable for high-frequency writes
