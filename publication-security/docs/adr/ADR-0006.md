# ADR-0006: Unified Authentication via Application Default Credentials

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system must authenticate securely across local and cloud environments
without embedding credentials.

## Decision
- Use Application Default Credentials (ADC)
- Firebase Admin SDK initialized via ADC
- Secrets stored in Google Secret Manager
- IAM-controlled access via service accounts

## Rationale
- Single authentication mechanism everywhere
- No service account JSON in source or containers
- Strong least-privilege enforcement

## Consequences
- Requires correct IAM configuration
- Developers must authenticate locally via gcloud
