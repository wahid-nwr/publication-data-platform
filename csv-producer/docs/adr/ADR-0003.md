# ADR-0003: Stream-Based CSV Ingestion

## Status
Accepted

## Context
CSV files can be large and may exceed available heap memory if loaded eagerly.

## Decision
- Use stream-based CSV parsing (OpenCSV)
- Convert rows to DTOs incrementally
- Publish parsed records as events or batches
- Avoid loading entire files into memory

## Rationale
- Enables processing of very large CSV files (10GB+)
- Predictable memory footprint
- Allows parallel downstream consumption

## Consequences
- More complex control flow than eager parsing
- Requires careful error handling and offsets
